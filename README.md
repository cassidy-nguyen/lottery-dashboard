# Powerball Data Cleaning & Analysis
This project processes raw Powerball data from the Texas Lottery site and produces clean, analysis-ready datasets. The cleaned data is then visualized in Tableau to explore number frequencies, most/least common numbers, and long-term trends, with context around the 2015 rule change that expanded the main ball pool.

## Tableau Dashboard

## What the Script Does
- Reads raw CSVs with or without PowerPlay
- Builds a wide format file (one row per draw)
- Builds a long format file (one row per ball) - better for frequency analysis
- Exports a simple data dictionary for reference

---

## How to Run
The project uses **Paver** to automate tasks.
1. Install dependencies:
```
paver setup
```
2. Process the raw data:
```
paver process
```
- Looks in data/raw for any .csv files
- Runs `clean_powerball.py` on each one
- Outputs cleaned files into data/processed/<filename>/
3. Clean up generated files:
```
paver clean
```

## Getting the Full Dataset

For demo purposes, only a small `powerball_sample.csv` is included in this repo.

If you want to work with the complete history:
1. Go to the [Texas Lottery Powerball page](https://www.texaslottery.com/export/sites/lottery/Games/Powerball/Winning_Numbers/).
2. Download the full CSV export of historical results.
3. Save it to `data/raw/` (e.g., `data/raw/powerball_full.csv).
4. Run the cleaner on it with:
```
paver process
```
This will generate cleaned outputs for the full dataset under `data/processed/powerball_full/`

## Key Insights
- Most frequent main ball: 23
- Least frequent main ball: 65
- Most frequent Powerball: 24
As of September 9, 2025

## Dashboard Features
- **Main Number Frequencies**: bar chart of how often each main ball (1-69) has been drawn
- **Powerball Frequencies**: bar chart of how often each Powerball (1-26) has been drawn
- **Trends Over Time**: line chart showing draw frequency patterns by year
- **KPI Cards**: highlight most frequent/least frequent numbers and total draws
